# zombie-map-stackathon

Zombie Map is a data visualization map of NYC's buses, represented as 'zombie hordes', via MTA's real-time bus API and other points of interests built with react-mapbox and Uber's deck.gl. This was built over a 3 day period as part of Full Stack Academy of Code's "Stackathon". We were challenged to experiment with new technologies and APIs and try to build something fun or interesting.
